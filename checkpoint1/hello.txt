Hello! My name is Preeti Raj. Pronouns - she/her

I am a freshman pursuing Data Science Engineering major (formally still undeclared though) with Biology minor. I am passionate about Bioinformatics and personalised medicine.

Fun facts about me - I am usually voted as the most easy going in a group. I am a dog person, have a slight addiction to coffee, love F.R.I.E.N.D.S and my name literally translates to "Love King" in my native language (Kannada)
